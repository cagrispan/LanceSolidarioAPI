#LanceSolidarioBackend

Group of APIs and services to serve Lance Solid√°rio system. This APIs are composed
 by one great API called LanceSolidarioAPI, other API called Pagseguro and three smaller 
 services called auction-end, auction-cancel and jqueue-process.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can clone the this repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

You also must have MySQL installed. You can get it from [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm], which is installed with Node.js.

The project is structured like:
 ```
 LanceSolidarioAPI (main folder)
    - auction-cancel (service)
    - auction-end (service)
    - db (database configuration)
    - jqueue-process (service)
    - pagseguro (API)
    - src (Main API)
 ```
 
 To run project is necessary install all dependencies for all services
 and APIs. To do it is necessary open cmd and inside of each service or API folder
  (auction-cancel, auction-end, jqueue-process, pagseguro, src)
 run command:
```
npm install
```

You should find that you have a new folder called node_modules, in your main folder(LanceSolidarioAPI),
as well in services and APIs folders(auction-cancel, auction-end, jqueue-process, pagseguro).

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

Besides it, you will find a folder called db with a sql file to create the necessary database,
even as a file called createDB that can be used to create the same structure on database.

### Run the Application

To run the project is simple, all you have to do is get in project folder and run command:

```
node app.js
```

Now server is running on port 7780.
